Just walked out of the   theater after seeing Cleaner and holy moly, my head's spinning like my old blender when it just won't work right. This 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮’s got me feeling a cocktail of I-don’t-knows. First off, Samuel L. Jackson as a former cop turned cleaner? Made me think about how I'd love someone like him to clean up the massage table after a long day with clients. Seriously, as if cleaning crime scenes wasn't already a gig to make you question your life choices.

Can we talk about how the   jumps all over the place? It's like listening to my grandma's stories—just when you're following along, she throws in a plot twist about her neighbor’s cat. One minute you’re in the thick of a mystery, the next it’s all about family drama. I was left trying to puzzle it all together, like a massage therapist with tired fingers trying to locate a particularly evasive knot.

> And then there's the daughter. I swear, her teenage angst could power a small country. She’s in her own world, reminding me of those clients who come in with their shoulders practically glued to their ears, trying to keep the world at bay. I felt for her though. Maybe because my own kid's got that same look, like they're about ready to yell at Siri for existing.

Once or twice, the   was a slow burn—like, really slow. I’m talking molasses trying to escape a jar in the middle of winter slow. I nearly considered 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥𝘪𝘯𝘨 the   later to double-check what happened because I must've zoned out like I do during a particularly boring yoga video.

Okay, I also have to mention that while I love a good twist, sometimes less is more, right? Like not every massage needs hot stones and aromatherapy. The plot got knotty enough to need its own deep tissue session, with sideways glances and tension cranked up to 11. And then you think it’s predictable, but BAM, they pull the rug out from under you. 

let cleanerReveal = true; if(cleanerReveal) { showPlotTwist(); } else { continueConfusion(); }

So would I 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again? I mean, maybe, if only to hang out with Samuel L. Jackson doing his thing. But I guess I'd tell a friend, if you're curious and like a sprinkle of chaos with your whodunit, go ahead, 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  . Or have it on in the background while you desperately try to untangle the mysteries of that client text that just came in—I'm sure there’s a hidden meaning in both.
